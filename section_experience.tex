        {I did retail level trading of EUR-USD using MetaQuotes' MetaTrader 4 platform.\\
        I wrote three successful "expert advisers" (MetaQuotes wording) that traded\\
        automatically for me.\\
        Unfortunately, the continued success relied upon me continuously finding new\\
        patterns when others stopped working because of large time-frame market pattern shifts.}

        {Systems Engineer / Software Engineer}
        {I setup the development network (SVN, Jenkins, binary distribution website, OpenVPN)\\
        and worked with our EE and lead architect/developer to create a networked digital\\
        signage platform that consisted of:\\
        - custom FPGA based high resolution image player with uClinux and a Nios II processer\\
        - C++ wxWidgets based client for content creation, scheduling \& player management\\
        - C++ server using a A daemon for content distribution and client interaction\\
        - drivers and userland programs written in C\\
        - player configuration web UI written in C\\
        - Wrote automation binaries and shell scripts for the build process.\\
        - NSIS installer for our software products\\
        - internationalized the application (which landed some foreign sales…)\\
        - Doxygen source code documentation\\
        - Developed an RS232 communication program for external machine control.\\
        - Implemented subversion, a revision control system,\\
          thereby increasing development efficiency and averting risk of lost work.\\
        - Implemented a bug tracking and submission system. This prevented wasted time\\
        and interruptions from people giving us bug reports in person or email.\\
        We now get the reports in a nice orderly fashion.\\
        - Programmed a bug reporter application to aid in the communication between\\
        the software users and our department.\\
        - Developed key parts of our complex application suite.\\
        - Developed a cross platform service implementation using shared memory\\
        and TCP/IP in a reactor pattern for the IPC.\\
        - Developed a character driver and daemon for our embedded product to handle\\
        reset button presses.\\
        - Currently transitioning the development team to use industry best practices.\\
        - Share in the administration of two of the development servers.\\
        - Built a redundant development server in order to mitigate loss of work from a\\
        failure of the main server.\\
        - Implemented an intranet development site where others in the company can acquire\\
        nightly builds and assist in the black box testing of the software.\\
        - Setup Jenkins (Hudson) for our team to use for continuous integration.\\
        - Implemented SSH and VPN for our development department so that we could continue\\
        our work from home when needed.}
